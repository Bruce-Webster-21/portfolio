        <p>Hello, I'm Bruce Webster, a Teacher and Front-end Developer fluent in English, Spanish, and Italian. With a diverse background in education and programming, I bring a unique blend of skills to my work. I embarked on my teaching journey in 2019, where I discovered my innate ability to connect with students and foster their learning. However, it was in 2020 that I stumbled upon the world of programming and instantly found my passion ignited.</p>
        <p>Starting with Python, I delved into the intricacies of web development and quickly found myself captivated by its limitless possibilities. As I immersed myself in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including its frameworks like React.</p>

If you're looking to enhance your online presence, I am eager to collaborate with you. Whether you need a modern website, an engaging e-commerce platform, or a customized web application, let's work together to turn your vision into a reality. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
